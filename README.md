# SwiftType-Challenge

This project is a simple Speed Typing Test web application built using
HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, incorporating the Bootstrap framework for styling.
The application fetches a random quote from a public API and displays it for the user to type. 
It includes a timer to measure the typing speed and provides feedback on the correctness of the input.
